          POEM <br/>

          Roses are red, violets are blue,
          In the garden of my heart, only blooms you.
          <br>

          Your smile is my sunrise, your laugh my sweet melody,
          Your love is the magic, that sets my spirit free.
          <br>

          On this day of roses, under the sky so wide,
          I wish to be always, forever by your side.
          <br>

          With a rose in my hand and love in my heart,
          I promise you darling, we'll never be apart.
          <br>

          So here's a rose, as a symbol of my love,
          You, my darling, are a gift from above.
